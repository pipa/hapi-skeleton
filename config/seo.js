// The sight of dry land after a long cruise is always welcome; and the fact that cruise passengers are only afforded a mere few hours at each docking point, makes time spent off the boat even more valuable. This is why Roatan Excursions offers guests the opportunity to forget their sea legs for a bit by instantly transporting them to a number of relaxing and engaging locations, safe in the knowledge that no precious time will be wasted.



// A selection of all-inclusive special day passes are available for visitors who wish to make the most of Roatan’s famously picturesque beaches and crystal clear waters. Roatan Excursions also offers guests a wide range of activities, including zip-lining, diving, and snorkeling.

// Located between the islands of Útila and Guanaja, Roatan is the largest of Honduras’ Bay Islands while only being around 48 miles (77 kilometres) long and less than 5 miles (8 km) across at its widest point. Fortunately, given that it is surrounded by translucent waters teaming with marine life—including Roatan Marine Park— and a huge array of fun-filled island activities for the whole family, Roatan caters to all comers, making Roatan Cruise Port an ideal docking point for cruise ships.

// Our fleet of four Roatan diving boats are ready and waiting to take you to any one of Roatan's fascinating dive spots, each bursting with vibrant aquatic wildlife. <a href="/about-us/">Roatan Excursions</a> dive masters are fully trained and professional to ensure all guests are 100% safe for the entire trip, with each group holding a maximum of eight divers so there is no need to worry about overcrowding.
